          <div style="float:left; width: 55%;">
            <p>Saturday evening a group of flamingos
              were found near a local park. There were eight of them seen.
              Some of the people there thought it was a good idea to feed them some of their hot cheetos.
              After they stopped, the flamigos got dissapointed and chased the people there. It has been discovered
              that the flamingos have escaped from a zoo nearby. One of the gates there was left open
              allowing the flamingos to leave. There has been professionals sent to retrieve the flamingos
              and they will be taken back to the zoo. Seems like flamingos have a high spice tolerance.
              They will be checked in order to make sure the food they have eaten will not be harmful
              to their health in any way.

            <p>Rainfall over an extended period and an extended area can cause major rivers to overflow their banks.
              The water can cover enormous areas. Downstream areas may be affected, even when they didn’t
              receive much rain themselves. While the water level slowly rises, officials can decide to evacuate
              people before the river overflows. The area that is flooded can be huge. Villages surrounded by large
              stretches of water were cattle would normally graze. Whole communities can become isolated from
              the rest of the world as roads are blocked and communications are down.

            <p>The Australian box jellyfish carries enough venom in its tentacles his to kill
              more than 60 people. A single sting from can cause excruciating pain, scarring and
              even cardiac arrest leading to “death within minutes” if the exposure is large enough.
              But now researchers at the University of Sydney have found a way to block the venom’s ability to destroy cells.
              The team used the genome-editing method known as CRISPR to work out exactly how the venom attacks,
              before using a cholesterol-absorbing drugs called cyclodextrins to prevent it from killing cells.
              The antidote blocks the symptoms of a box jellyfish sting if administered to the skin within 15 minutes after contact.
              It was shown to work on human cells outside the body and then tested effectively on live mice.
              The Australian pain researchers now hope to develop a topical application for humans.

            <p>If there's an unofficial snack of the coronavirus pandemic, it's a sweet, soft loaf of home-baked banana bread.
              In March, Chrissy Teigen made headlines when she traded a
              loaf of her signature banana bread for a bag of romaine lettuce after discovering that Los
              Angeles grocery stores were sold out. As screen time goes up for many Americans, Ohana said that baking is a
              valuable chance to unplug.
              "Do something that's much more of a sensory experience." Even the simple, repetitive movements of baking,
              such as stirring batter, cracking eggs and kneading bread can bring mental health benefits, Ohana said.

              valuable items from tourists in order to exchange them for better food, research shows.
              Researchers found the enterprising monkeys have sophisticated knowledge of which items tourists consider most
              valuable and which are likely to net them the best returns when bartered for food.
              The team from the University of Lethbridge in Canada spent 273 days at the temple in Bali and recorded
              over 2,000 interactions between the monkeys and tourists.

            <p>An iceberg larger than New York City has broken off an ice shelf in Antarctica, scientists say.
              The 490-square mile glacier broke off the Brunt Ice Shelf, where the British Antarctic Survey’s
              Halley Research Station is located, the research organization announced. New York City is
              approximately 302 square miles. The rift then pushed northeast more than half a mile a day
              starting in January, cutting through the 490-foot thick ice shelf, scientists said. The iceberg
              formed when the crack widened on Feb. 26, releasing it from the ice shelf.

              about 15 miles (24 kilometers) offshore from Myrtle Beach. It’s the third right whale death recorded
              since the rare species’ calving season began in November along the southern East Coast.
              The same entangled whale was seen again in mid-February off Florida, where a team of experts was
              dispatched but was unable to free the whale. However, the 2021 calving season has proven to be the best in years.
              Survey teams dispatched to search by air for right whale mothers and newborn calves have so far
              spotted 15 calves — the most reported since 2015.

            <p>The Kanawha River is expected to crest below flood stage Tuesday but that crest will still be the highest for the Kanawha since November 2003.
              That’s an indication of the widespread river flooding in West Virginia following heavy weekend rains that began Friday and continued into Monday morning.
              Tony Edwards, meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Charleston Weather Bureau, said the entire state picked up significant rain from Saturday night into Monday morning.
              “Anywhere from four to five inches of rain across the southern coalfields up to a little less than 2 inches in the northern part of the state and over in the eastern panhandle,” he explained.
              The National Weather did cancel the Elk River flood warning in Kanawha County Monday evening.

            <p>The health and welfare ministry is just one of the agencies that operates community-based services, residential facilities and a transitional living home for young people in the Mountain State.
              At age 18, young people in foster care have a critical decision to make.
              “We do have options in our state,” said Marilyn Pearce, regional director for the Children’s Home Society of West Virginia, a private, nonprofit child welfare organization.
              “We have options for children whether or not they want to remain in the state’s custody after the age of 18 or if they would like to sign out and go their own ways.”
              Dale suggested lawmakers invest more in transitional living, technical skill training, workforce development, building reuse and other housing options for young people coming out of foster care.

              The Arizona Cardinals have muscled their way into that class with a series of bold moves, the latest of which adds J.J. Watt, arguably the greatest pass rusher in the history of football.

            <p>Featuring an eccentric magical creature and a Disney princess you really wouldn’t want to mess with in a fight, the animated “Raya and the Last Dragon” is an epic and sassy fantasy adventure for youngsters not yet ready for “Game of Thrones."
              Directed by Don Hall (“Big Hero 6”) and Carlos López Estrada (“Blindspotting”), “Raya” (★★★ out of four; rated PG; in select theaters and streaming on Disney+ Friday) is a Southeast Asian-inspired melding of magic, comedy, some goofiness, strange animals and butt-whupping warrior women. With Kelly Marie Tran voicing the sharp-tongued title character and Awkwafina amazingly inhabiting an adorably oddball water dragon, the film wrestles with tonal inconsistencies but features fantastic action scenes to go with a touching underlying narrative about the power of trust.

            <p>Vaccines have brought the United States tantalizingly close to crushing the coronavirus within its borders. After months of hiccups, some 1.4 million people are now being vaccinated every day, and many more shots are coming through the pipeline. The Food and Drug Administration has just authorized a third vaccine — a single-dose shot made by Johnson & Johnson — while Pfizer and Moderna are promising to greatly expand the supply of their shots, to roughly 100 million total doses per month, by early spring.

The Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, reminiscent of coup attempts in Third World countries, sent a loud and troubling message to the world.

            <p> Zoom Video Communications Inc. said its growth would continue at a rapid pace amid the vaccine rollout, after pandemic lockdowns turned the company into a household name and an investor darling. The videoconferencing company said Monday that revenue this year would rise more than 41% after more than quadrupling to $2.65 billion in the fiscal year ended in January. The sharp growth during last year repeatedly outpaced Zoom’s own projections, and the latest result beat a forecasted issued in November.
