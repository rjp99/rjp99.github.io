      Hey! I am a senior at The University of Texas at Austin. I am a 
      dedicated student working toward my goal of becoming a software 
      engineer. When I'm not programming, you can find me watching 
      Netflix, reading, or learning to bake and cook.

      I started coding while I was in high school which made 
      me decide to minor in it while at UT. While taking many different 
      classes related to computer science, I realized this is what I enjoy 
      doing most. I enjoy coding because it really makes a person think 
      about how many of our everyday things work, and even better, I can 
      get involved in developing some of those things.
